        <h2>Vladimir Lenin</h2>
        <p> Vladimir Lenin was a Russian revolutionary leader and theorist, who presided over the first government of
            Soviet Russia and then that of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Lenin was the leader of the
            radical socialist Bolshevik Party (later renamed the Communist Party), which seized power in the October
            phase of the Russian Revolution of 1917.As revolutionary leader of the Soviet state, he signed the Treaty of
            Brest-Litovsk with Germany (1918) and repulsed counterrevolutionary threats in the Russian Civil War. After
            the revolution, Lenin headed the new Soviet government that formed in Russia. He became the leader of the
            USSR upon its founding in 1922. Lenin held the highest post in the Soviet government until his death in
            1924, when Joseph Stalin assumed power. </p>

        <h2>Joseph Stalin</h2>
        <p> Joseph Stalin (1878-1953) was the dictator of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from 1929 to
            1953. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union was transformed from a peasant society into an industrial and military
            superpower also his Red Army helped defeat Nazi Germany during World War II. However, he ruled by terror,
            and millions of his own citizens died during his brutal reign. Noted for bringing the Soviet Union into
            world prominence, at terrible cost to his own people, he left a legacy of repression and fear as well as
            industrial and military power. Joseph Stalin died on March 5, 1953, in Moscow. His death triggered a
            leadership scramble within the Soviet Communist Party, and Nikita Khrushchev ultimately emerged as Stalin’s
            successor. </p>

        <h2>Mikhail Gorbachev</h2>
        <p> Mikhail Gorbachev was a Soviet politician. Gorbachev served as the last general secretary of the Communist
            Party of the Soviet Union (1985–91) as well as the last president of the Soviet Union (1990–91). Both as
            general secretary and as president, Gorbachev supported democratic reforms. He enacted policies of glasnost
            (“openness”) and perestroika (“restructuring”), and he pushed for disarmament and demilitarization in
            eastern Europe. Gorbachev’s policies ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990–91. It was
            replaced by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a free association of sovereign states founded by
            the elected leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus (Belorussia). </p>
